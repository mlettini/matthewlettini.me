I‘m a software designer and developer that’s been building, improving, and shipping digital product experiences since 2008. My goal is to make life easier for people, one pixel at a time.

I’ve spent more than a decade doing this at [Harvest](https://getharvest.com), building a world-class time tracking product alongside a world-class team. Previously I was designing new ways to purchase and listen to music online at [Songza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songza) and [Amie Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amie_Street).

I excel as a product generalist, blurring the line between product designer and product manager. My experiences and skills have led me to wear many hats, including product strategist, project manager, team lead, customer researcher, data analyst, mentor, and a million other things in between.

I’m also a designer who codes and spend a lot of my time designing in and writing HTML & CSS. Lately I’ve been particularly interested in developing design systems and optimizing information architecture.

Beyond the desk I’m a [new puppy](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXeYImOFqui) dad-in-training, an out-of-practice musician, and an avid gamer always ready to min-max a new D&D character. I love basketball, karaoke, the oxford comma, and a good cognac.

I’m currently working remotely from Brooklyn, NYC. You can say hello by emailing [mlettini@gmail.com](mailto:mlettini@gmail.com) or finding me @mlettini in most places.
