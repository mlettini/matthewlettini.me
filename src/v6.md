ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Matthew (but my friends call me Lettini). Iâ€™m a product designer thatâ€™s been building, improving, and shipping digital product experiences for over 15 years. My goal is to make life easier for people, one pixel at a time.

Currently Iâ€™m building fun stuff at <a href="https://goodenough.us" target="_blank">Good Enough</a>. Previously I spent more than a decade at <a href="https://getharvest.com" target="_blank">Harvest</a>, where I helped build a world-class time tracking system alongside a world-class team.

I excel as a product generalist. While I specialize in designing human solutions to customer problems, I tend to wear many hats, including project manager, team lead, strategist, researcher, data analyst, and a million things in between. Iâ€™m also a designer-who-codes and spend a lot of my time in HTML & CSS.

Beyond the desk Iâ€™m a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXeYImOFqui" target="_blank">new puppy</a> dad-in-training, an out-of-practice musician, and an avid gamer always ready to min-max a new D&D character. I love hiking, basketball, karaoke, the oxford comma, and a good cognac.

Iâ€™m currently working remotely from Brooklyn, NYC. You can keep in touch at <a href="mailto:mlettini@gmail.com?subject=Hello!" target="_blank" aria-label="Email me">mlettini@gmail.com</a> or finding me @mlettini in most places.
